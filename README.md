GitHub team instructions

• Clone the repository to your machine

• Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal

• Check node version is at least 10 (node -v)

• Check npm version is at least 6 (npm -v)

• npm install

• install grunt cli (npm install -g grunt-cli)

• grunt (ALWAYS run 'grunt' command before doing any work)

• Create a sass partial in /src/scss as: _yourname.scss

• Create a script file in /src/js as: yourname.js

• Edit main.scss to enable your partial

• Create your local branch (git checkout -b yourname)

• Push your local branch to the remote repository (git push -u origin yourname)

• Files not related to the project must be added to the .gitignore

• NEVER work on or push to the master branch

• Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code: first push to your remote branch so it's up to date, then push to the master-dev branch and resolve any conflicts

• Create your local version of the master-dev (git checkout -b master-dev)

• Every time you merge to the master-dev branch, let the other team members know. They MUST switch to the master-dev branch ASAP and pull (git checkout master-dev) + (git pull origin master-dev) Once this has been done you can switch back to your branch and continue working

• Merge to master-dev often to keep conflicts resolved
